>Claim 

Firstly, if you find this helpful or it is rabbish but still get some inspiration from here, please give a star to encourge me keep writing!

If you want to get original data for non-bussiness purpose, leave your email in issues

For the code I upload, plz read the comments before you run it. You may need to initialize some tokens in order to use certain packages (tushare, aip). For private concern I didn't share my transfer learning mdoel's model ID, but you can train one easily using [paddlehub](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHub/blob/release/v1.5/docs/tutorial) and easydl. And if you want to use words embedding, download embedding file and set the file path first. I didn't provide it since there are plenty of well-trained embedding models in github already

>Goal

trying to use NLP tech to predict the stock. 

## literature review

[S&P market intelligence](http://pages.marketintelligence.spglobal.com/rs/565-BDO-100/images/MI-Research-NLPLitSurvey-170725.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWlRoa016WmlZVEZpT1RRMyIsInQiOiJ2bklHRUptZFwvMFlDQ3duK3c3VGRPbklqMEpZM3dJVlhEb29GWng0bnlHRVFMbWVBdUlLV1VUQ2R4dW4xaExIYlRkRkVvbXBNT0tHRmFyRHY5V0R1a3VxZUNybkRzYjd5eXNPVzh0bVFLOEhhTndTTzJOY2JrTm5LY2NIWFlwXC9qIn0%3D) mainly foucus on earning call transcript analysis, which can be a direction for further improvement.


## Method 1: train our own model
Improve existing models 

[股市情感分析（股吧）](https://github.com/algosenses/Stock_Market_Sentiment_Analysis)先把文本tokenlize，然后用标注好的中文文本训练（with lab postive or nagative），然后用各种模型训练，最后得到sentiment score.使用2018年数据


>Remark:

 1.Although the orignial author did segmamention in raw dataset, at the tokenization step his model still divide a sentence into chars instead of words.
 2. Although from above picture it fits well, when we foucs on clsoe price change, you can see its prediction power is not so appealing...

 I tried this model and use it to predict the stock '000002.SZ'. Similar as above, results are frustrating😒. Worse still, my correlation is much lower. The reason may be that the training set is too small and not suitable.( the training set is from the forums of index, not of this stock) 
 
update: improve this model , tried embedding and conduct backtest, but still cannot find a stable profit strategy. The model 
is a bad model: low F1 score.

For DL, it is much worse. I have only 10000 labeled text sets, while there are much more parameters for NN, casuing severe overfitting. The loss decayed in train set but diverged in test set
 

### Reflection: is word segamentation necessary?
In Chinese, a word, instead of a character, is the smallest unit to express meaning. However, in reality using char is a better idea.

There are several reasons why it's unnecessary: 
 1. segamentation in Chinese is much more difficult to implement，and there are different standards for word segamentation. This process will introduce another kind of error. 
 2. we don't know in neutral network' eyes, whether words or characters express the meanings better. With the development of deep learning models，like RNN, LSTM, BERT, models using charaters improved a lot. 
 3. the word matrix is too sparse, meaning high overfitting risk. And there are lot's of OOV, which restricts the model's preformance.
 4. to be continoued
 
## Method 2: transfer learning
use ernie model provided by baidu

I tried: 
 1. use dataset provided by baidu and may financial dataset.
 2. use my financial dataset only.

The first method achieved 90% accuracy in testset. The I use this model to classify sentiment socre and calculate each day's sentiment score. With the sentiment score we can start to construct our strategy.

A simple strtegy is long if yesterday's sentiment is larger than a threshold (here I set as mean plus 0.5 sd) and sell if smaller mean minus 0.5 sd

<p align="center">000002.SZ 万科 annual return 40% & sharpe 1.8 <p align="center">
 
>Update : we can build a little bit more complex strategies.

Here I set the first half data as train set and second half as test set. The normal strategy is relatively trival here: long if the sentiment score larger than a threshold (here I set as mean plus 0.5 sd) and sell if smaller mean minus 0.5 sd, after i+1 days. Here i is the look back window, a non negative integer that I want to optimize in train set. For simplicity i is restricted in [0,1,2,3,4] (also avoid overfitting)

Below is part of the result:

<p align="center">Remark: low performance.  <p align="center">

>Remark

 1.The model in fact returns two sentiment score: one discrete label [0,1,2] and one continuous positive probability. The results are similar.
 
 2.The strategy for 000858 seems to doesn't work at all. Reason may be the market has changed a lot(for example, before and after 2015). Strategy should be adjusted every one or two year
 
 3.Sometimes the stock price go to the opposite direction of market sentiment. Based on my limited knowledge, some possible explanation: 
   - There are lots of informed traders in A markets, therefore if there is some good news, the informed traders would long stock and  stock price will increased before the chaos traders read the good news, then the informed traders will try to sell their stocks and price went down.
   - People discard opposite emotion in forums on purpose (to mislead other traders)
   - If all participants have long position, no more free cash to buy, when ppl unwind, it triggers others to cut loss or unwinding position in a row, therefore, a stronger momentum
 
 4. following 3, I found for liquor industry(wu liangye, moutai) the normal strategy will make profit, where for the rest stocks I have tried it is the contrarian strategy that wins. So may it also depends on the industry? To be verified by investigating more stocks...
 
 5. thanks my freind Alex, a CS Phd candidate, helping me build a SOTA model to classify texts. Since this model is accurate enough and his paper is still in review, I just use my transfer learning model here.

## Method 3: direct predict stock price change

output of brainstorm: define independent variable as Y_i= i day's close pct_chg > mean + 1 sd

similar as above, trained models by myself( use ml and dl models) and transfer learning. Both are affected by the imbalancing problem, since most Y = 0. The  f score is very low

>Reflect
stock price are affected by many factors. If we just use posts and comments to **predict** it, then it is pure data mining and has no economic explanation, which is quite dangerous.
## work list...
 
 (updated on 2nd, May)
 
- [x] tokenzie before word2vec  --turns out useless. Reason has been discussed above
- [ ] study the relationship between sentiment score in weekends and the pct_change in next Monday --remain for further study
- [ ] analyze the earning call scripts, making use of knowledge in behaviour finance. --typical for foreign markets; hard to find for companies in A stock
- [ ] make use of the comments under the posts  --technically easy, leave to future when I have spare time
- [ ] make use of the read count and reply conut  --how should we make use of this metric? Maybe we can regard them as measure of the post's influence and use them to weight the sentiment socre. Leave to future when I have spare time
- [ ] make use of the sentiment in weekend. There is no trade in weekend, which means every week there are two day's sentiment score wasted --Maybe we can add them to Monday's sentiment score?
- [ ] upload more powerful posts scratch code
